# JavaScript Lab Exercises

This project contains a set of JavaScript practice exercises designed to strengthen understanding of functions, arrow functions, object literals, dynamic property access, and prototype-based inheritance using `Object.create()`.

## Contents

- **Part 1: Function Syntax**
  - Exercise 1: Function declaration `calculateArea(length, width)`
  - Exercise 2: Function expression `calculatePerimeter(length, width)`

- **Part 2: Arrow Functions**
  - Exercise 3: Use `map()` to square numbers  
  - Exercise 3: Use `filter()` to get even numbers  
  - Exercise 3: Use `reduce()` to sum numbers  

- **Part 3: Object Literals**
  - Exercise 4: Create `student` object with methods:
    - `getFullName()`
    - `enrollCourse(courseName)`
    - `getCourseCount()`
  - Exercise 5: Create `book` object with functions:
    - `displayProperty(obj, propertyName)`
    - `updateProperty(obj, propertyName, newValue)`

- **Part 4: Object.create() and Prototypes**
  - Exercise 6: Create `vehicle` and `car` objects, demonstrate inheritance
  - Exercise 7: Build multi-level prototype chain (`manager -> employee -> person`)
  - Exercise 8: Method overriding with `shape`, `rectangle`, and `circle`
